#Sets are collection of unique data,i.e, elements of a set cannot be duplicated
#Sets are unordered, meaning the elements in a set are not in a specific order
#Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.

#To create empty sets we use the set()function
#Creating sets that are not empty we use the {} function
